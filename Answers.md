<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
<h3>1)</h3>
<p>
We implemented the Singleton-Pattern in the “Board” class and the “Scoreboard” class (which we implemented in Part 3), 
because it should have only one instance of each of them during the running program. 
Furthermore, the implementation of this pattern provides a global point of access the instance of both classes. 
Therefore, we don’t have to give the instance of the board to the pieces.
